# Earn the Fanatic Badge on Stack Overflow

A Python script deployed to Heroku that performs automatic logins on stackoverflow.com on a regular basis, so that you can earn the **Fanatic** badge, effortlessly.

[Fanatic Badge](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/83/fanatic)
> Visit the site each day for 100 consecutive days. (Days are counted in UTC.).

Moreover, you get notified, via email, if the script goes wrong and you havenâ€™t logged into Stack Overflow for at least _twelve hours_.

## Step-by-step guide

You may follow the step-by-step guide [here](https://medium.com/coders-do-read/earn-the-fanatic-badge-on-stack-overflow-828d2c46930).

And the second part, with additional improvements, [here](https://medium.com/coders-do-read/fanatic-badge-on-stack-overflow-part-two-email-notification-820f5394f8f0).

Alternatively, you can follow the (less detailed) quick start below.

## Quick start

1. Make sure you have the following dependencies:

  - Python 3.6+ (along with pip)

  - Chrome installed (or another browser of choice, though you will have to edit the script)

  - Python packages (use `pip install` to get): `selenium`, `sendgrid`, `webdriver_manager`, `requests_oauthlib`, `apscheduler`

2. Edit `env_vars.txt` to include your email, password, and display name.

3. Run `source env_vars.txt` and then `python3 stack_overflow_page.py`.

## Troubleshooting

The script can trigger a CAPTCHA from StackOverflow. A human has to resolve this.
